title: "Resolutions"

I'm keeping this one short. The goals for the year will be the following:

- Code 10 hours a week on non work related stuff
- Exercise 7 hours a week
- Write a blog post every week

I'll break down each of these resolutions in slightly more detail.

# Coding

The people I respect the most are prolific coders with insane output. The best way to achieve this is by well...
coding a lot. It's easy to motivate myself to code for work. However I don't think I can truly get any
level of mastery unless I also make sure to find joy in it outside of the workplace. The biggest issue
with coding outside of work/school in the past is my inability to truly get going with a project. Without
deadlines, and expectations from others,  it's hard to drive a project from start to finish, especially when the
steps are large and poorly defined. A short list of programming projects that I started but never finished
because of the immense amount of quit in me:
- AwkLang (an implementation of the Awk programming language)
- TallyUp (A p2p sports betting app)
- HarkDB (A GPU powered query engine... this one made it slightly farther than the others)
- FutharkCXX (A C++ file generator to wrap Futhark's generated C API into classes)
- StatFloor (A WebScraper for sports data)

This is just to name a few projects that I have failed to drive to a respectable point. By writing code 10 hours a
week I am giving myself a fighting chance of actually driving a project to the finish line in a way that I can be proud of.

# Exercise

I used to go to the gym for 2 hours everyday. Then I moved back to America and haven't worked out in 6 months. 
I lost 20+ pounds is mildly devastating. I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror, and think that's one big boy! I need to find a gym and or fall
back in love with calisthenic exercises. 

# Blogging

Writing a blog post every week will improve my technical writing ability. It's pretty insane how bad I write. I read most of my
written English with genuine disdain. This is what happens when 98% of writing is done via texting, and messaging. Writing a blog
post a week will help bridge my writer's block. It will also allow me to get a better feel for writing concise, structured paragraphs
and sentences. I have many things I want to write about. To name a few:
- My thesis
- Something about MLIR
- Getting a consistent development environment across platforms
Everytime I encounter a niche bug, I have an opportunity to write a blog post, both to solidify my knowledge and a possible way to help some
unlucky developer who might by some miracle come across the same issue. Its also clear to me that in technical conversations I lack the ability
to communicate my ideas with the correct terminology. Writing will definitely help with that one.



# Conclusion
What's weird about life is that I am super happy with where I am. 
For the first time in my life I don't feel behind in some non-existent race.
I am working on compilers, at an innovative company and I'm excited to go to work (virtually) everyday. 
However there is always room for improvement. At the end of the day I want to be proud of future me.
If I code 10 hours a week outside of work, exercise an hour a day, and write a blog post once
a week, it's nearly impossible that won't be the case.
